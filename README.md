I utilized Python and its libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn to clean and process the data, ensuring its accuracy and consistency. Then visualising the data using different graphs, charts so that it provides meaningful insights into the business's performance. This  easy visualization of key metrics, helps to identify trends, optimize operations, and support data-driven decision-making.
